**Goal:**
Understand how socioeconomic and demographic factors relate to fatal police encounters in the U.S. (2015).

**Questions to answer:**

1. What are the affected demographic groups?
2. In which areas (low-income/higer-poverty) are the incdents concentrated?
3. Do certain states show higher per-capita rates?
4. If time allows: does “armed vs unarmed” correlate with any tract-level features?

**Framework & Tools:** Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly)
